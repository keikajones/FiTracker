#FITracker

### Description
FITracker is site where people with an active lifestyle can come together and share their fitness/health goals, workout routines, health recipes, etc. I got the idea from being on Facebook and other social media platforms and noticing that my friends would list postings of their workouts or videos and it would get lost in the mix of everything else that's shared on these platforms. So I thought if they had a place where they can share their passion with like-minded people they can get more interaction and feedback. Hence, FITracker.
